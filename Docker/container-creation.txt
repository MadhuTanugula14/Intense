Notes

A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings.

Features of Containers:

Are lightweight

Fewer resources are used

Booting of containers is very fast

Can start, stop, kill, remove containers easily and quickly

Operating System resources can be shared within Docker

Containers run on the same machine sharing the same Operating system Kernel, this makes it faster

You can use the command
docker container create
to create a container in stopped state
